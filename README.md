### IMPORTANT NOTE: It is only viable to use it in 1280x720 resolution, for 1080 pixel height format I will bring it later, also, make sure you haven't changed the safezone screen values. And finally, it only works for the latest Beta version.

# VDX: Project 4JD UI

### An legacy console UI design for MC Win10 Bedrock.

#### Description ####

Is an testing/experimental museum resource pack that would change some UI designs, and the goal of this project is convert from default UI to high accuracy 4JD (Legacy Console) UI TP for Bedrock Edition users, replacing some designs to look more similar!

The UI design was originally made by Julie "Danger" Kennedy from 4J Studios! I simply recreate the UI port for Bedrock Edition ;D.

For now it will be designated only for High-end PC Windows 10 or Last Gen Consoles.

For mobile (Mini version, even for Switch) it will be available for late 2022.

#### Current Features ####

#### To do list ####

- CE 3x3 and 2x2 Crafting screen (10%, still in progress).
- Pause screen.

#### License ####

This project will be open source and under the GNU GPL v3.0.

#### Rules to test ####

The only prerequisite before testing is:
- To have High-end PC with Windows 10 Installed.
- Or to have Xbox Series S/X or PS5 console.

Otherwise, the bug report will likely be ignored (So, don't do it if you have mobile device).

It is highly recommended to use only with the Xinput control, the use with keyboard and mouse will work partially.

At the moment, you can:
- Test and report bugs.
- Make reviews about project 4JD if you want. (At your own risk)

You can't:
- Redistribute the master (current) version to other pages.

#### Known Issues ####

- It takes about 14 seconds to open the inventory screen. But it only happens once and it will take less than 2 seconds more than the second time.
- At the moment, it is not recommended for use with another resource pack, much less when applied to a single world.
